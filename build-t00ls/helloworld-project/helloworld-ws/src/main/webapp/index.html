    <head><title>Hello from Siarhei Kazak</title></head>

    <body>

      <h1>That's my customized change to the original helloworld-ws</h1>
      <p>

        The <i>helloworld-ws</i> quickstart demonstrates the use of <b>JAX-WS</b> in
          Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform as a simple Hello World application.

       There is no user interface, because I didn't have time to draw it. Instead, you might want to verify the
         Web Service is running and deployed correctly by accessing the following URL:
         </p>
         <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
         <a href="HelloWorldService?wsdl">HelloWorldService?wsdl</a>
         </div>
         <p>
          But... This URL will not work properly on my server as well. Feel free to blame Administrator.
      </p>
